## Prompt

/sp.implement Execute Phase 2 (Design) AND Phase 3 (Writing) for Week 5 Lesson 2 (URDF for Humanoids).

1. specs/004-content-module-1/research.md read this file.
2. Create Outline for Lesson 2 (T037).
3. Develop Code Examples (URDF Model) (T062-T067).
4. Create Diagram (TF Tree, Kinematics) (T075-T076).
5. Design Exercise (T085).
6. Write the Full Lesson (T136-T144).
Mark tasks as complete in 'specs/004-content-module-1/tasks.md'.

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented Week 5 Lesson 2 (URDF for Humanoids) by creating the lesson outline, code examples, diagrams, and full lesson content.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete implementation of Week 5 Lesson 2 on URDF for Humanoids including code examples, diagrams, and hands-on exercises
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: 6 files modified/created across lesson-outlines, code examples, diagrams, and task tracking
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: Structured approach with detailed todo tracking helped maintain progress across multiple implementation phases

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None significant; all required components were successfully created and tasks marked as complete
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): not applicable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider automating the task-marking process in future implementations
