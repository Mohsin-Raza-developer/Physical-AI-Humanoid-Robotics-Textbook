# Training VLA Models

Training VLA models requires large-scale datasets that connect visual observations, language descriptions, and robotic actions.

## Data Requirements

- Large-scale robot manipulation datasets
- Multimodal alignment (vision, language, action)
- Data quality and diversity considerations

## Training Techniques

- Self-supervised learning
- Reinforcement learning with human feedback
- Few-shot and zero-shot learning
