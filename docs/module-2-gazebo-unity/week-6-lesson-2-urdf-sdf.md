# Week 6 Lesson 2: URDF and SDF Robot Descriptions

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Work with SDF (Simulation Description Format)
- Convert between URDF and SDF formats
- Create robot models for Gazebo simulation

## Prerequisites

- Completed Week 6 Lesson 1 on Gazebo setup
- Basic understanding of XML syntax
- Familiarity with 3D coordinate systems

## Introduction
