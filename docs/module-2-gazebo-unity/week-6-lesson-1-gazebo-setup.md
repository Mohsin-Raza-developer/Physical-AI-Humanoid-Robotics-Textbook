# Gazebo Fundamentals

Gazebo is a 3D simulation environment for robotics that provides realistic physics, high-quality graphics, and convenient programmatic interfaces.

## Key Components

- Physics Engine (ODE, Bullet, Simbody)
- Rendering Engine (OGRE)
- Sensors (cameras, lidar, IMU, etc.)
- Robot models and world files
