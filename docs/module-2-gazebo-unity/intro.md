# Module 2: Digital Twins - Gazebo & Unity Simulation

**Weeks 6-7** | Physics-Based Robot Simulation

Simulation environments allow you to test and validate robot behaviors safely before deploying to physical hardware. This module covers Gazebo for physics-based simulation and Unity for high-fidelity visualization, teaching you to create digital twins of humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments for robot testing
- Create accurate robot models using URDF and SDF formats
- Simulate realistic physics, sensors, and environmental interactions
- Integrate Unity for advanced visualization and robot interaction
- Connect ROS 2 with simulation environments
