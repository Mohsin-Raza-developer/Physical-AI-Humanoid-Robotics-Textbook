# VLA for Robotic Control

VLA models enable robots to follow complex language instructions by connecting perception, language understanding, and action generation.

## Control Strategies

- Policy learning with VLA models
- Language-guided manipulation
- Visual servoing with language commands
- Hierarchical task planning
