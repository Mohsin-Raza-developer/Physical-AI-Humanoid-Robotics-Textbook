# VLA Model Architectures

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a new class of foundation models that connect vision, language, and action modalities in robotics.

## Key Architectures

- End-to-end learning approaches
- Modular architectures with specialized components
- Transformer-based architectures
- Multimodal fusion techniques
