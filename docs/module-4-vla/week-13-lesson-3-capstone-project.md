# VLA in Physical AI Systems

This section explores how VLA models can be integrated into Physical AI systems, enabling robots to understand and execute complex language instructions in physical environments.

## Integration Challenges

- Real-time inference requirements
- Robustness to environmental variations
- Safety and reliability considerations
