# Physics and Sensors in Simulation

Realistic physics and sensor simulation are critical for effective robotics development and testing.

## Physics Simulation

- Rigid body dynamics
- Collision detection
- Force and torque application

## Sensor Simulation

- Camera sensors
- LIDAR and depth sensors
- IMU sensors
- Force/torque sensors
