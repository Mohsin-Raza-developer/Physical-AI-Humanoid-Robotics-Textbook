# Module 1: ROS 2 - The Robotic Nervous System

**Weeks 3-5** | Robot Operating System 2 Fundamentals

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is the essential middleware that serves as the "nervous system" for robots, coordinating communication between sensors, actuators, and AI algorithms. This module provides hands-on experience with ROS 2 architecture, node development, communication patterns, and robot description formats.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand ROS 2 architecture, nodes, and the publish-subscribe model
- Build custom ROS 2 packages using Python and colcon
- Implement communication patterns: topics, services, and actions
- Create and manage launch files for complex robot systems
- Design humanoid robot descriptions using URDF

## Weekly Breakdown

| Week | Topics | Lessons | Deliverables |
|------|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Week 3** | ROS 2 Core Concepts | • Lesson 1: ROS 2 Architecture<br />• Lesson 2: Nodes & Packages | Basic ROS 2 package with publisher/subscriber nodes |
| **Week 4** | Advanced Communication | • Lesson 1: Services & Actions<br />• Lesson 2: Building ROS 2 Packages | Service and action implementations |
| **Week 5** | Robot Description & Launch | • Lesson 1: Launch Files & Parameters<br />• Lesson 2: URDF for Humanoids | Launch file system and humanoid URDF model |
