# Topics, Services, and Actions

ROS 2 provides three primary communication patterns between nodes:

## Topics (Publish/Subscribe)

Topics enable asynchronous communication through a publish/subscribe model.

## Services (Request/Response)

Services enable synchronous communication through a request/response model.

## Actions

Actions enable goal-oriented communication with feedback and status updates.
