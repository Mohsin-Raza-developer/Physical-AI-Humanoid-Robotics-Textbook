# ROS 2 Architecture

The Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is designed to be a flexible framework for writing robot software. Unlike traditional approaches, ROS 2 is not an operating system but a collection of tools and libraries that provide implementation for many of the functions that a robot needs.

## Key Concepts

- Client Library Implementations
- DDS/RMW Abstraction
- Packages and Composable Nodes
- Parameters and Configuration

## DDS and RMW

The Data Distribution Service (DDS) and the ROS Middleware (RMW) abstraction layer are fundamental to ROS 2's design.
